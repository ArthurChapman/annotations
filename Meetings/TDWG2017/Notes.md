# Annotations Interest Group Meeting TDWG 2017 #

Present: Lutz Suhriber, Paul Morris, Okka Tschoepe, Alex Thompson, Arthur Chapman. 

Introductions.

Alex Thomoson as new Co-Convener.

Question raised by Walter B. Merge the annotations IG into DQ IG.

Discussion: Overlap, but distinct.  Arthur and Alex don't see them merging.  

Some notes from SPNHC:

Reviewed using W3C annotation data model assertion wrapping a data quality assertions.  Seen as good fit, some details to be worked out.

Looked at using measurement or fact to record annotations.  Viewed as not a good idea.

Alex: Reverse: map measurement or fact and resource relationship into annotations - assert reslurce relations as 

Annotations into vocabulary suggested by John W.

Alex: Who adds things to vocabularies.  Life Stage vocabulary.  Every addition to vocabulary gets an annotation indicating the source.

Arthur Advanatage of annotations 

Lutz: Using annotations of annotations in AnnoSys, ultimately up to the curator to accept or act on.

Arthur: Avoiding repeated annotations of potentially problematic data that are actually not problematic, benefits both consumers of data and curators of data.

Alex: Scope of Annosys? 

Lutz: Annosys: As propagator of messages.

Alex: To what extent is Annosys able to update source databases?

Lutz: No access to the source database - difficulties with schema mapping.

Acton Item (create issue): Propose a Task Group charter for an Applicability Statement about the W3C annotation data model and use cases/best practices for data quality assertions using the W3C annotation data model.
