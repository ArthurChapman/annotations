# Annotations Interest Group

## Rationale

This group serves as a forum for the discussion of mechanisms and concepts for the annotation of all kinds of biodiversity data.

The Annotations group will discuss, evaluate, propose, and standardize mechanisms for the collection, distribution, and storage of annotations of biodiversity data. The scope of annotations is potentially broad, encompassing, among others, structured and unstructured textual data, multimedia, and data set metadata, with obvious interactions with other TDWG groups and with existing and proposed standards in the domain.

The group provides a forum for the advancement of existing and new mechanisms for the annotation of biodiversity data towards standards related to the structure, capture, transport, and management of annotations. The group will develop:

1. Summary information about annotation standards and mechanisms for both data in general and scientific data in particular;
2. Descriptions of annotation concepts and annotation management technologies in use and in development in the biodiversity informatics community;
3. Descriptions of implementations of annotation capture, transport, and management mechanisms in use and in development in the biodiversity informatics community; and
4. Applicability statements of annotation standards and concepts from other communities.

## How to contribute

*Depending on where group interaction takes place (GitHub, mailing list), provide some guidance on how interested parties can follow group activities (e.g. watch this repository, join mailing list) and how they can contribute.*
